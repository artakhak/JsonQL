These tests were added at the beginning of development of JsonQL.
Later on a better structure for tests was designed, and the tests in this folder do not have much value.
Everything in tests in this folder is already tested in JsonValuePathElements (as well as in some other tests).
This folder should be either deleted or tests should be moved to tests in JsonValuePathElements folder.
