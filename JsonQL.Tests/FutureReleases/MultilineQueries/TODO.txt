Add tests that test error messages with invalid format.
When we load JSON (before JSON is parsed to JsonQL expressions), we should 
concatenate the values in "$multiline" array (see test files), and replace the JSON value which contains
$multiline" field with concatenated string.
However, if any errors happen, we should map the error location info to original location data before
the lines were concatenated using the position data of replaced JSON values.
